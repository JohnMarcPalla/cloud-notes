# Configuring IAM Permissions with gcloud
#### GSP647

![Google Cloud self-paced labs logo](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/GMOHykaqmlTHiqEeQXTySaMXYPHeIvaqa2qHEzw6Occ%3D)

## Overview

This lab looks at three common areas to understand with regards to IAM and gcloud:

- the configuration of the gcloud environment
- the use of multiple gcloud configurations
- the use of services accounts

In this lab you use the `gcloud` CLI tool to set up and configure command features of Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM).

### What I learned

In this lab, I did the following:

- Review IAM and using the `gcloud` client
- Create and switch between multiple IAM configurations
- Identify and assign correct IAM permissions
- Create and use a service account

### Environment overview

You start with two user accounts and two projects;

- `user1` is the "owner" of both projects
- `user2` is the "viewer" of only the first project.

There is a Linux virtual machine (vm) running in the first project.

### Review: What is IAM

Google Cloud offers Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM), which lets you manage access control by defining who (identity) has what access (role) for which resource.

In IAM, permission to access a resource isn't granted directly to the end user. Instead, permissions are grouped into roles, and roles are granted to authenticated principals. (In the past, IAM often referred to principals as members. Some APIs still use this term.)

#### Identities

In Cloud IAM, you grant access to _principals_. Principals can be of the following types:

- Google Account
- Service account
- Google group
- Google Workspace account
- Cloud Identity domain
- All authenticated users
- All users

Learn more about these identity types from the [Concepts related to identity Guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#concepts_related_identity).

In this lab, you use Google accounts, service accounts, and Cloud Identity domain groups.

#### Roles

A role is a collection of permissions. You cannot assign a permission to the user directly; instead you grant them a role. When you grant a role to a user, you grant them all the permissions that the role contains.

Learn more about roles from the [Roles Guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#roles).

### Review: What is gcloud?

The gcloud CLI is a part of the Cloud SDK. You must download and install the SDK on your system and initialize it before you can use the gcloud command-line tool. You can use this tool to perform many common platform tasks either from the command-line or in scripts and other automations.

Learn more about gcloud from the [gcloud CLI overview Guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/#what_is_the_gcloud_command-line_tool).

## Task 1. Configure the gcloud environment

This lab already has a Compute Engine instance called **centos-clean** that simulates an environment that doesn't have `gcloud` installed. You connect to this instance using the Google Cloud console.

1. Open the list of compute instances by going to **Navigation Menu** > **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**.

![[Pasted image 20240207212930.png]]

2. On the line with the compute instance named **centos-clean**, click **SSH**.

![[Pasted image 20240207213053.png]]

3. First test, confirm that `gcloud` is successfully installed by checking the version. Inside the SSH session run:
```
gcloud --version
```

![[Pasted image 20240207213108.png]]

##### After verification that `gcloud` command-line tool is installed , make some changes by creating a compute instance.

1. First, authenticate in gcloud. Inside the SSH session, run:

```
gcloud auth login
```

![[Pasted image 20240207213511.png]]

Press 'Y' and ENTER when you see the prompt _Do you want to continue (Y/n)?_

2. Navigate to the link displayed in a new tab.

![[Pasted image 20240207213625.png]]

3. Click on your active username, and click **Allow**. You will be redirected to this page.

![[Pasted image 20240207213743.png]]

4. When you see the prompt **Enter the following verification code in gcloud CLI on the machine you want to log into**, click on the copy button then go back to the SSH session, and paste the code into the prompt **Enter authorization code:**.

![[Pasted image 20240207213818.png]]

5. In the SSH session, set the region and zone:

```
gcloud config set compute/region us-central1
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-c
```

![[Pasted image 20240207214005.png]]

6. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud compute instances create lab-1 --zone us-central1-c --machine-type=e2-standard-2
```

![[Pasted image 20240207214052.png]]

7. You can press ENTER to accept the default zone for this VM.

Check the VM created by this commands

![[Pasted image 20240207214212.png]]

The created VM has a same name as set by the command in step 6. And the correct region and zone set in step 5.

8. Check your current gcloud configuration. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud config list
```

![[Pasted image 20240207214633.png]]

You now see a `compute` section, a `core` section, and an `active configuration`. You can change each of these, but for this lab you'll only change the zone. Look at the zone your VM was created in.

9. Now list all the zones available to use by running the following inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud compute zones list
```
10. Identify one of the other zones in the same region as you. For example, if your current zone is `us-west2-a`, you could select `us-west2-b`.

11. Change your current zone for another zone in the same region. Inside the SSH session run the following, replacing `ZONE` with the zone you selected:

```
gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
```

![[Pasted image 20240207214844.png]]

12. Verify the zone change was made. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud config list
```

![[Pasted image 20240207214917.png]]

You see the stated zone reflects the change you made.

You can change other settings using the `gcloud config set` command. Those changes are permanent; they are written to your home directory.

The default configuration is stored in **~/.config/gcloud/configurations/config_default**.

If you want to use a zone other than the default zone when creating an instance, you can use --zone switch. For example, 

```
gcloud compute instances create lab-1 --zone us-central1-f
```

13. Verify the zone was written to the configuration file. Inside the SSH session run:

```
cat ~/.config/gcloud/configurations/config_default
```

![[Pasted image 20240207215105.png]]

You can see the configuration is just stored as text and can be backed up or copied.

## Task 2. Create and switch between multiple IAM configurations

You have now set up one account. In situations when you need to work on different teams or access different accounts, you can also manage that with `gcloud config`.

In your next task you learn how to create a second configuration and switch between both of them.

##### Create a new IAM configuration

In this lab you have a second Google account you can log on with. This account has read-only (viewer) access to the first project. You create a new configuration for that user.

1. Start a new `gcloud` configuration for the second user account. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud init --no-launch-browser
```

2. Select option 2, _Create a new configuration_.
3. _configuration name_: Type **user2**.
4. _Log in with a new account_: select option 3 - you're logging in with the other provided user name.
5. Press ENTER when you see the prompt _Do you want to continue (Y/n)?_

![[Pasted image 20240207215633.png]]

6. Navigate to the link displayed in a new tab.
7. Click _Use another account_
8. Copy the second user account (`student-02-10dfe35b3fa9@qwiklabs.net`), and paste into the _email or phone_ prompt.
9. Copy the same password that you started the lab with, and paste into the _enter your password_ prompt.
10. Click **I understand**.
11. Click **Allow**.

![[Pasted image 20240207215729.png]]

You are accepting that the Cloud SDK has the same access as your Google account.

12. When you see the prompt **Enter the following verification code in gcloud CLI on the machine you want to log into**, click on the copy button then go back to the SSH session and paste the code into the prompt **Enter authorization code:**.
13. For **Pick cloud project to use:** locate your current project (`qwiklabs-gcp-04-cee45f4656ba`) and then type in the number that corresponds to the project.

![[Pasted image 20240207215813.png]]

The initialization completes and you see the zone and region are set for you.

##### Test the new account

This new account has viewer only access to the project, so you can test that you are indeed using this account by trying to view and then create some resources.

1. Check that you can view details in the first project. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud compute instances list
```

The second user account has viewer access so you should see `centos-clean` and `lab-1` instances listed.

![[Pasted image 20240207215943.png]]

2. Check that you cannot create an instance in the first project, as your assigned role is basic viewer. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud compute instances create lab-2 --machine-type=e2-standard-2
```

![[Pasted image 20240207220008.png]]

Because the second user account has only viewer access, they are not allowed to create an instance, so this command fails. It takes a little time to fail.

3. Change back to your first user's configuration (**default**). Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud config configurations activate default
```

You are now back to using your original user account credentials. Later you switch between these two accounts as you learn about roles and permissions.

To override the configured zone for just that one time when running a gcloud command, append `switch --zone DIFFERENT_ZONE` to the command.

## Task 3. Identify and assign correct IAM permissions

You have been provided two user accounts for this project. The first user has complete control of both projects and can be thought of as the admin account. The second user has viewer only access to the two projects. Call the second user a devops user and that user identity represents a typical devops level user.

Next you use `gcloud` to configure access to one project for the devops user by creating a custom role for the project that permits creation of buckets and instances.

##### Examine roles and permissions

1. To view all the roles, run the following inside the SSH session run:

```BASH
gcloud iam roles list | grep "name:"
```

The list of roles is returned. The addition of `grep "name:"` to the command reduces the amount of data returned to just the names of the roles.

Inspect one of these roles to see the permissions assigned to the role. To view the permissions use `gcloud iam roles describe`. Try looking at the simple role **roles/compute.instanceAdmin**.

2. Examine the `compute.instanceAdmin` predefined role. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud iam roles describe roles/compute.instanceAdmin
```

You can see **roles/compute.instanceAdmin** has many permissions, but these are the minimum needed for later:

- compute.instances.create
- compute.instances.delete
- compute.instances.start
- compute.instances.stop
- compute.instances.update
- compute.disks.create
- compute.subnetworks.use
- compute.subnetworks.useExternalIp
- compute.instances.setMetadata
- compute.instances.setServiceAccount

To review the full list of roles and the permissions assigned, refer to the [IAM permissions reference Guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/permissions-reference).

##### Grant access to the second user to the second project

Now that you know that roles contain permissions, how do you assign a role (and therefore all the associated permissions), to a user account?

There are two ways to attach a role:

- To the user and an organization
- To a user and a project

Next you attach the basic role of "viewer" to the second user onto the second project.

##### Test that the second user doesn't have access to the second project.

1. Switch `gcloud` configuration back to the second user (**user2**). Inside the SSH session run:

```BASH
gcloud config configurations activate user2
```

Now you're back to `user2`.

2. Set `PROJECTID2` to the second project. Inside the SSH session, run the following:

```BASH
echo "export PROJECTID2=qwiklabs-gcp-02-26e6b5fa7060" >> ~/.bashrc
```

```BASH
. ~/.bashrc
gcloud config set project $PROJECTID2
```

**Note:** This command appends the `bashrc` file, so be careful.

You get a warning: `WARNING: You do not appear to have access to project [your 2nd project id] or it does not exist.`

3. When prompted, _Do you want to continue (Y/n)?_, type N and press ENTER.

This means that user 2 doesn't have access to the PROJECTID2 project, which you fix in the next section.

![[Pasted image 20240207220936.png]]

##### Assign the viewer role to the second user in the second project

1. Switch back to the **default** gcloud configuration, which has the permission to grant access to the second user. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud config configurations activate default
```

2. Install `jq`:

```
sudo yum -y install epel-release
sudo yum -y install jq
```

![[Pasted image 20240207221051.png]]

Next, set the value of `USERID2` to the second user name and bind the role of viewer to the second user onto the second project.

3. Inside the SSH session, run the following:

```
echo "export USERID2=student-02-10dfe35b3fa9@qwiklabs.net" >> ~/.bashrc
```

```
. ~/.bashrc
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECTID2 --member user:$US
```

Once you have run the command, the text looks something like the following (you may need to scroll up):

```
Updated IAM policy for project [qwiklabs-gcp-02-26e6b5fa7060].
bindings:
...

- members:
  - serviceAccount:qwiklabs-gcp-02-26e6b5fa7060@qwiklabs-gcp-02-26e6b5fa7060.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/storage.admin
- members:
  - user:student-03-2d1c5f8a6eb6@qwiklabs.net
  - user:student-02-10dfe35b3fa9@qwiklabs.net
  role: roles/viewer
```

## Task 4. Test that user2 has access

1. Switch your gcloud configuration to **user2**. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud config configurations activate user2
```

2. Change the configuration for user2 to the second project. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud config set project $PROJECTID2
```

You should not see an error message this time.

3. Verify you have viewer access. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud compute instances list
```

You now see 0 instances in this project.

4. Try to create an instance in the second project as the second user. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud compute instances create lab-2 --machine-type=e2-standard-2
```

![[Pasted image 20240207221612.png]]

This command fails because user2 only has viewer access to the project.

5. Switch your gcloud configuration to **default**. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud config configurations activate default
```

You are now back to using your original user account credentials.

##### Create a new role with permissions

Next, create the new role with the set of permissions needed for the devops team.

- Create a custom role called `devops` that has the permissions to create an instance. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud iam roles create devops --project $PROJECTID2 --permissions "compute.instances.create,compute.instances.delete,compute.instances.start,compute.instances.stop,compute.instances.update,compute.disks.create,compute.subnetworks.use,compute.subnetworks.useExternalIp,compute.instances.setMetadata,compute.instances.setServiceAccount"
```

![[Pasted image 20240207221732.png]]

This command creates a custom role in the project called `devops` with the permissions to create and manage instances.

The full name of the role is listed, note the role is in the project so the path is in the pattern of `projects/PROJECT/roles/ROLENAME`.

##### Bind the role to the second account to both projects

You now have the role created and need to bind the user and the role to the project. Use `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding` to perform the binding. To make this command easier to execute, set a couple of environment variables first; the project id and the user account.

1. Bind the role of `iam.serviceAccountUser` to the second user onto the second project. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECTID2 --member user:$USERID2 --role=roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
```

You need permissions to create an instance with a service account attached. The role `iam.serviceAccountUser` has those permissions, so use this pre-defined role.

```
[student-03-2d1c5f8a6eb6@centos-clean ~]$ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECTID2 --member user:$USERID2 --role=roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
Updated IAM policy for project [qwiklabs-gcp-02-26e6b5fa7060].
bindings:
...
...
...
...
- members:
  - user:student-02-10dfe35b3fa9@qwiklabs.net
  - user:student-03-2d1c5f8a6eb6@qwiklabs.net
  role: roles/viewer
etag: BwYQy18BZE4=
version: 1
```

2. Bind the custom role `devops` to the second user onto the second project. You can find the second user account on the left of this page. Make sure you set USERID to the second user account.
3. 
Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECTID2 --member user:$USERID2 --role=projects/$PROJECTID2/roles/devops
```

Once you have run the command, the text that looks something like the following (you may need to scroll up):

```
Updated IAM policy for project [qwiklabs-gcp-02-26e6b5fa7060].
bindings:
- members:
  - user:student-02-10dfe35b3fa9@qwiklabs.net@qwiklabs.net
  role: projects/qwiklabs-gcp-02-26e6b5fa7060/roles/devops
```

##### Test the newly assigned permissions.

1. Switch your gcloud configuration to **user2**. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud config configurations activate user2
```

Now you're back to user2.

2. Try to create an instance called lab-2. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud compute instances create lab-2 --machine-type=e2-standard-2
```

Now the instance creation works for user2.

Create an instance with name as lab-2 in Project 1

![[Pasted image 20240207222346.png]]

3. Verify the instance exists. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud compute instances list
```

##### Your environment

After these last changes your environment looks like this:

![Lab progress illustration](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/vQmuNdGi2s6SF7kyAShW8L5eNnHBQCUwDwDtKTwWWmc%3D)

When binding an IAM role to a project, project ID and account is to be provided.
## Task 5. Using a service account

You have seen how to authenticate and use `gcloud` to access Google Cloud services with roles. Now you'll look at a typical approach.

You have an application that uses the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to read and write to Cloud Storage buckets. You don't want to have to authenticate every time you launch a new server, that would be both painful and not in the spirit of using the cloud! So, you use __service accounts__.

A service account is a special Google account that belongs to your application or a virtual machine (VM) instead of to an individual end user. Your application uses the service account to call the Google API of a service so that the users aren't directly involved.

Learn more about service accounts from the [Service accounts Guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts).

Now you create a service account, use that service account with a compute instance, then test that the service account allows the access you need.

##### Create a service account

1. Switch your gcloud configuration to **default**, `user2` doesn't have the rights to set up and configure service accounts. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud config configurations activate default
```

2. Set the project to `PROJECTID2` in your configuration. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud config set project $PROJECTID2
```

Make sure you are targeting the right project.

3. Create the service account. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts create devops --display-name devops
```

Check the created devops service account

4. Get the service account email address. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts list  --filter "displayName=devops"
```

**Note:** The filter shows only the line you are interested in. Notice that the email address contains the role name and the project id.

5. Put the email address into a local variable called `SA`. Inside the SSH session run:

```
SA=$(gcloud iam service-accounts list --format="value(email)" --filter "displayName=devops")
```

This command sets the SA local variable to the email address of the service account. Pretty useful right?

```
[student-03-2d1c5f8a6eb6@centos-clean ~]$ gcloud config configurations activate default
Activated [default].
[student-03-2d1c5f8a6eb6@centos-clean ~]$ gcloud config set project $PROJECTID2
Updated property [core/project].
[student-03-2d1c5f8a6eb6@centos-clean ~]$ gcloud iam service-accounts create devops --display-name devops
Created service account [devops].
[student-03-2d1c5f8a6eb6@centos-clean ~]$ gcloud iam service-accounts list  --filter "displayName=devops"
DISPLAY NAME  EMAIL                                                        DISABLED
devops        devops@qwiklabs-gcp-02-26e6b5fa7060.iam.gserviceaccount.com  False
```

6. Give the service account the role of `iam.serviceAccountUser`. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECTID2 --member serviceAccount:$SA --role=roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
```

```
dent-03-2d1c5f8a6eb6@centos-clean ~]$ SA=$(gcloud iam service-accounts list --format="value(email)" --filter "displayName=devops")
[student-03-2d1c5f8a6eb6@centos-clean ~]$ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECTID2 --member serviceAccount:$SA --role=roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
Updated IAM policy for project [qwiklabs-gcp-02-26e6b5fa7060].
bindings:
...
...
...
- members:
  - user:student-02-10dfe35b3fa9@qwiklabs.net
  - user:student-03-2d1c5f8a6eb6@qwiklabs.net
  role: roles/viewer
etag: BwYQy4yEgRc=
version: 1
```

This role allows the service account to assign a service account to a compute instance.

## Task 6. Using the service account with a compute instance

1. Give the service account the role of `compute.instanceAdmin`. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECTID2 --member serviceAccount:$SA --role=roles/compute.instanceAdmin
```

This role allows the service account to manage compute instances.

2. Create an instance with the devops service account attached. You also have to specify an access scope that defines the API calls that the instance can make. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud compute instances create lab-3 --machine-type=e2-standard-2 --service-account $SA --scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute"
```

Access scopes are the legacy method of specifying permissions for your instance. Access scopes are not a security mechanism. Instead, they define the default OAuth scopes used in requests from the `gcloud` tool or the client libraries. They have no effect when making requests not authenticated through OAuth, such as gRPC or the SignBlob APIs.

You must set up access scopes when you configure an instance to run as a service account.

A best practice is to set the full cloud-platform access scope on the instance, then securely limit the service account's API access with IAM roles.

Access scopes apply on a per-instance basis. You set access scopes when creating an instance and the access scopes persist only for the life of the instance.

Access scopes have no effect if you have not enabled the related API on the project that the service account belongs to. For example, granting an access scope for Cloud Storage on a virtual machine instance allows the instance to call the Cloud Storage API only if you have enabled the Cloud Storage API on the project.

```
[student-03-2d1c5f8a6eb6@centos-clean ~]$ gcloud compute instances create lab-3 --machine-type=e2-standard-2 --service-account $SA --scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute"

```


## Task 7. Test the service account

1. Connect to the newly created instance using `gcloud compute ssh`. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud compute ssh lab-3
```

Press ENTER when asked if you want to continue.

Press ENTER twice to skip making a password.

```

```

2. The default image used already contains `gcloud` configuration. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud config list
```

The configuration now has the service account

3. Create an instance. This tests that you have the necessary permissions via the service account:

```
gcloud compute instances create lab-4 --machine-type=e2-standard-2
```

You can press ENTER to accept the default zone for this VM.

4. Check roles attached are working. Inside the SSH session run:

```
gcloud compute instances list
```

```
